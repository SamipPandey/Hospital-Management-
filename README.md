The system features a strict **Role-Based Access Control** biometric-simulated login. Access is segmented into four tiers:
* **Administrator:** Full financial control, HR management, and clinical overrides.
* **Senior Physician:** Patient intake, clinical diagnosis, and lab prescriptions.
* **Lead Pharmacist:** Inventory logistics, drug pricing, and patient billing.
* **Patient Portal:** Public-facing interface for real-time bill verification.

### 📊 2. Financial Integrity Engine (v12.0 Update)
* **Zero-Negative Logic:** Prevents "Minus" values in bills using `Math.max()` validation.
* **Live Revenue Tracking:** Real-time calculation of Net Profit vs. Doctor Commissions.
* **Tax/GST Compliance:** Automatic 18% tax calculation on all medical services.
* **Audit Logging:** Every financial transaction is recorded in the Terminal Security Audit.

### 🩺 3. Intelligent Clinical Intake
* **Symptom Analyzer:** Uses logic from `hospital_management.c` to suggest specialized clinics (Cardiology, Orthopedics, etc.) based on keywords.
* **Dynamic Ward Management:** Supports General Wards, Private Suites, and Emergency Critical Care (ICU) logic.
* **Laboratory Integration:** Full diagnostic suite including MRI, X-Ray, and ECG charging modules.
