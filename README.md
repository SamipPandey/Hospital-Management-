Welcome to **HMS Enterprise v19.0**, a high-fidelity Hospital Management System built with a focus on **Liquid Glass Aesthetics** (inspired by iOS 26/VisionOS) and **Absolute Fiscal Integrity**. This system provides a seamless experience for administrators, medical professionals, and patients alike.

## 💎 Design Philosophy: "Infinity Glass"
The system utilizes a custom-built **Liquid Glass Engine** featuring:
*   **Dynamic Mesh Gradients:** A radial-depth background that shifts with user interaction.
*   **Frosted Glass Logic:** 45px backdrop blurs with 210% color saturation for a premium feel.
*   **Spring Physics:** All buttons and modals utilize high-frequency cubic-bezier curves for a "snappy" tactile response.
*   **Responsive Engine:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop environments.

## 🔐 Access Credentials Matrix
The system is protected by a biometric-style authentication layer with four distinct access tiers. Access the terminal using the following identity nodes:

| Role | Username | Password | Access Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Admin** | `admin` | `admin123` | Full Control, Fiscal Settlement, HR, & Logs |
| **👨‍⚕️ Doctor** | `doc1` | `123` | Intake Engine, Lab Requests, & Break Room |
| **💊 Pharmacist**| `pharm1` | `pharm123` | Drug Inventory & Prescription Dispensing |
| **👤 Patient** | `user1` | `0000` | Billing Search, Features, & Facility Gallery |
