Welcome to **HMS Enterprise v26.0.3**, the definitive pinnacle of hospital management engineering. Rebuilt from the ground up on the **Synchronized Crystal Engine**, this version bridges the gap between clinical diagnostics and pharmaceutical fulfillment with a high-fidelity, refractive interface designed for the next decade of healthcare.

## 💎 Design Philosophy: "Synchronized Crystal"
Version 26.0.3 introduces the most advanced UI framework in the series:
*   **Unbreakable Navigation Core:** Utilizing a **Relative Bounding-Box Engine** that calculates menu positions in real-time. This ensures the liquid glass "blob" follows your selection perfectly, regardless of role-based item visibility.
*   **Adaptive Specular Lighting:** A post-login "Sunlight Layer" removes visual darkness, providing a light, airy workspace while maintaining a 40px frosted glass depth.
*   **Metaball Fusion Engine:** Navigation items merge and separate with high-viscosity fluid animations, optimized for 100% text readability via Z-index priority layering.
*   **Dynamic Theme Engine:** A one-tap toggle between **Ultra-Light Refraction** and **Deep-Fluid Dark Mode**, with persistent local storage of user preferences.

## 🔐 Access Credentials Matrix (v26.0.3 Protocol)
Access to the terminal is strictly governed by the Quantum RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) layer. Dashboard telemetry and fiscal settlements are hard-locked to Administrator identity nodes.

| Role | Username (UID) | Password | Access Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ Administrator** | `admin` | `admin` | Full Telemetry, Fiscal Settlement, HR Roster |
| **👨‍⚕️ Senior Doctor** | `doc` | `123` | AI Intake, Laboratory Suite, Digital Prescribing |
| **💊 Lead Pharmacist**| `pharm` | `123` | Prescription Fulfillment, Inventory Ledger |
| **👤 Patient Node** | `user` | `0` | Medical Bill Resolution, Specifications, Gallery |

## 🚀 Quantum Modules

### 🩺 Doctor-to-Pharma Pipeline
The core breakthrough of v26.0.3. Doctors prescribe synthetic compounds directly within the **Clinical Intake Matrix**. These orders manifest instantly in the **Pharmacy Dispensing Queue**, where pharmacists fulfill requests and inject costs into the patient's fiscal node in one click.

### 🧠 AI Symptom Matrix
An integrated keyword analysis engine that monitors the **Symptoms Matrix** during intake. It provides real-time "AI Recommendations," suggesting the optimal medical sector (Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics, etc.) based on patient bio-input.

### 💰 Fiscal Command & Bio-Tax
*   **Global Net Liquidity Ledger:** High-precision tracking of Gross Yield, Professional Payouts, and an automated **18% Bio-Tax Liability** reserve.
*   **General Checkup Protocol:** A specialized OPD visit type that bypasses daily ward charges, applying a flat diagnostic fee for efficient outpatient processing.
*   **Settlement Node:** Hard-locked to Admin credentials, ensuring financial discharge is only executed by authorized fiscal officers.

### 🔬 Diagnostic Laboratory
Synchronized process queue allowing Senior Doctors to assign Hematology Core, Neural MRI, or Full Genomic Sequencing directly to active bio-nodes.

### 🖼️ Facility Visual Matrix
A strict **Tabular Grid Gallery** featuring 20 high-resolution architectural and clinical nodes. Optimized with **3D Refraction Hover Effects** and high-performance image scaling.

## 📜 Security & Persistence
*   **Audit Engine:** Real-time logging of all terminal interactions, including secure uplink establishment and clinical process completions.
*   **Quantum Persistence:** Zero-server architecture utilizing deep browser `LocalStorage` for persistent roster, patient, and financial records.
*   **Reflex Trainer:** A built-in high-latency **Staff Break Room Simulation (Snake Game)** to maintain clinical precision and staff reflexes during downtime.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Specification
*   **UI Core:** LGDS (Liquid Glass Design System) v31.0
*   **Graph Engine:** Chart.js v4.0 (Synchronized Scales)
*   **Typography:** Apple SF Pro Display / JetBrains Mono
*   **Refraction Radius:** 40px Gaussian Blur / 210% Saturation / 0.05 Refractive Alpha
